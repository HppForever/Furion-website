       - Added three new GUI themes to the theme list, namely "Brown cardboard", "Ghost", "Graphite shadow"<br><br>
       - Added ability to change the font of the text of the cheat/notify/hud menu and mini font pack in the archive (6 fonts)<br><br>
       -------------- Improved function "Goto":<br><br>
       - Replaced hitboxes checkboxes with a regular combo list, which saves space in the cheat menu and looks more beautiful<br><br>
       - Added "Auto duck" function, which automatically crouches while moving. This allows you to better defend yourself from enemies' blows and control your speed. However, do not forget to increase power when using this feature, as the player moves much slower in a ducked position than in a standing position<br><br>
       - Added "Auto shoot" function, which automatically shoots while moving. This function is useful, for example, if you want to nightmare someone, but not with a knife, but, for example, with AK-47<br><br>
       - The power of the sliders has been increased by a factor of 6, even though the values have remained the same (1-3000)<br>This means that if you set the power to 1000, for example, you will have 6000 power, and if you set the maximum power value to 3k, you will have 18000 power<br><br>
       - Now, as it should, the goto will fly to the nearest player, not a random one<br><br>
       ------------------------------------------------<br><br>
       - Added "Auto jof" function to "Movement->Other" and an edge slider for it<br><br>
       - The "Write hideradar on cs startup" function has been fixed. Now it correctly hides the default ks radar<br><br>
       - The "Function list" function has been fixed. Now it does not show the function in the list when the variable (checkbox) responsible for this function is inactive (state == true, cvar.enabled == false)<br><br>
       - Movement content has been fixed. Now, when the player dies, all functions of the Movement tab will be automatically turned off. This means that now you can safely die with the fps skipper, and there will no longer be a black screen<br><br>
       - Frame skipping (fps skipper) has been moved from the "Movement->Strafes" tab to the "Movement->Fps boost" tab. Also added combo list, in which you can select the condition of operation (always or only when rage strafe is working)<br><br>
       - Added content for knifebot<br><br>
       - Added Strafe helper to the "Movement->Strafes" tab<br><br>
       - Added possibility to display or not display a function in the list of functions (statistics) (implementation is similar to the "Visuals->Notify" tab)<br><br>
       - Added "Rage aim" function bind<br><br>
       - Added hand and scope removal, in the "Visuals->Local" tab<br><br>
       - Moved weapon hand change from "Misc" tab to "Visuals->Other" tab<br><br>
       - Added ability to resize kill log text

      <div class="accordion-body"> 
        - Changed the log about the successful injection of the cheat, now it is more informative<br><br>
        - When you create a new cfg, you will be greeted with a new GUI theme rather than a black and orange one<br><br>
        - Added 3 new GUI themes to the list of themes, namely "Green Water", "Blood Water", "Crystal"<br><br>
        - Now you have to go to Settings to change the location of the tabs (right or left), and there is no longer a "Swap" button at the top<br><br>
        - Now the bhop settings etc are stored in the "movement.ini" file, not in "kreedz.ini" as before. I suggest to move the settings to a new file or you can start from scratch<br><br>
        - Added "Afk mode" function for knifebot, it will be useful for legitimate game (you will not be able to hit someone when you write something in chat or went away on business)<br><br>
        ----------- Added new functionality for anti aim:<br><br>
        - Added on\\off button<br><br>
        - Added angle change button (for example, let the angle be "90" degrees = (90), (-90))<br><br>
        - Added the "Right rotation" side for the "Fake yaw angle" section<br><br>
        - Added "Change angle from strafe" function<br><br>
        - Added "Left" and "Right" sides for "Fake Yaw Angle", "Yaw Angle in Motion" sections<br><br>
        - Removed the unnecessary "Knife only" function<br><br>
        -------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>
        - The gui elements in the "GUI" tab work again, you can make your own themes without problems<br><br>
        - Added separators (lines separating the place) in the "Visuals" tab in sub tabs - for beauty)<br><br>
        - Added "AirStuck" function (hovering in the air) to the "Movement->Other" tab and the power slider to it (the higher the value - the more reliable we hover in the air, but there will be various glitches (such as - will not see messages, hear howling, etc))<br><br>
        - Added the ability to cancel the bind of any function using the "Cancel" button in the button type selection (hold, toggle) as well as Unbind list (reset buttons) in "Misc->Other"<br><br>
        - Removed unnecessary function "Enable SteamId spoffer" in "Misc->Other" now you just need to enable "Random SteamId" to change the steam id<br><br>
        - Now the "x" and "y" values in the statistics, as well as the width and length of the menus, etc, are set depending on your screen resolution. For example, if your resolution is 768x1024, the "x" slider value will be 768 and the "y" slider value will be 974 (-50 to stay within the screen width limit)<br><br>
        - The logic of the "Anti Afk" function has been rewritten, now it is enough to enable this function without setting the angle and time - there will be no detection<br><br>
        - Added the ability to change the hand based on the current weapon on the player (knife left, weapon right or knife right, weapon left)<br><br>
        - Added "List of functions" function to the "Visuals->Statistics" section. With its help you can see which functions are currently activated<br><br>
        - Removed the "(Ground) Max Speed (Degree)" slider in "Movement->Main" and the "(Bhop) Type" combo since it doesn't provide any use<br><br>
        - Added "FakeLag" function bind<br><br>
        - Added fog (crouch) customization for groundstrafe. Changing the fog allows you to perfectly jump off the boogarks or get into bushes, as well as visually stand out among other players. However, it should be noted that using this feature may lead to detection on servers with anticheat<br><br>
        - Added two buttons to "Console->Other" that allow you to spam with a flashlight or parachute<br><br>
        - Added two conditions for rage strafes: the first allows bhoping along with rage strafe, and the second allows groundstrafe (ddrun, sgs) along with rage strafe. These two conditions may come in handy for someone, for example, if someone is short on fingers<br><br>
        - Added team counter (tt, ct) to the "Statistics->Team Counter" tab<br><br>
        - Added Change speed, teleport, goto functions to the "Movement->Speed" tab

        - Added working conditions for Rage strafe for it to work (no conditions, only knife, work when we don't attack)<br><br>
        - Removed unnecessary condition to turn off rage strafe on ladders now departure from ladders more pleasant and also removed auto-save button in auto direction<br><br>
        - Now the minimum number of skip frames (skip frames) starts from 0 and ends at 5, since it makes no sense to set it more<br><br>
        - Added the ability to hide your pressed keys from the server and also spam them when activating rage strafe you can surprise someone :)<br><br>
        - Added two conditions for fake ping (Turn off when tt, Turn off when ct) - these checks are useful for hns and zm modes(on hns for example there is no sense to use fake ping when you tt, similarly on zm)<br><br>
        - Added Turn off when TT function for knifebot (useful for hns mode)<br><br>
        - Added a button to switch the strike for knifebot (stab/slash) useful for knife servers since slash hits farther than stab you can combine it and drag almost everyone
