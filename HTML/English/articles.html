            The thing is that any antivirus, seeing how something (cheat) is introduced somewhere (game) - starts to delete the cheat and block its introduction into the game<br><br>
            <b>⚙️ 2. Change the rendering type from software to OpenGL</b><br>
            To change the rendering type, you need to go to the CS settings, select the "Video" section and find the "Render" option. In this section you can change the rendering type from software to OpenGL<br><br>

            There are different builds (protective (with protector), crooked or defective (for example, if the author of the build - some neverfix), anti-cheater (GSClient and similar))<br>
            All of these types of cs - can really interfere with the implementation of the cheat.<br>
            So below - I have left for you a couple of common builds on which the cheat works normally:<br><br>

            This method is suitable for those who have a licensed CS 1.6 (purchased from Steam)<br>

            <img src="../../Images/Articles/Set beta cs version.png"></Images><br><br>
            <b>🔍 5. Installation of libraries on your windows (visual c+, net_framework)</b><br>

            As you could see, this item has an asterisk - this means this item may be optional (you can try this item if the above items - did not help with your problem)<br>
            You need to go to the "AppData\Roaming" directory (press win+r on your keyboard and type "AppData" - go to the Roaming folder) and delete the "Furion Cheat CS 1.6" folder.

          ✅ How to bypass any ban
        </button>
      </h2>
      <div id="3" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#Accordion">
        <div class="accordion-body"> 
            <b>📌 Let's start with a preface: there is no ban that can't be bypassed.</b><br><br>
            Ban type, difficulty, and circumvention:<br><br>
            <h2><b>1. Ban on Steam ID + IP (fresh_ban) (easy)</b></h2><br>
            <b>Steam ID</b> - is a player ID, which is usually used to store data (level, rating, privileges, etc)<br><br>
            To change the <b>Steam ID</b>, enable the function <b>Steam ID spoofer</b> in any cheat or protector, such as a protector <b>Xguard</b> it can be enabled with the command <b>xg_emu_set random</b> or <b>xg_emu_set "ID"</b> (to save data)<br><br>
            <img src="../../Images/Articles/Set random steamid.png"></Images><br><br>
            To change the <b>IP</b> address, enable <b>VPN</b> (if you have a static <b>IP</b>) or reboot the router by unplugging it for a while (if you have a dynamic <b>IP</b>)<br>You can find out what type of <b>IP</b> you have by following the link - <a href ="https://www.bolshoyvopros.ru/questions/416583-kak-uznat-javljaetsja-li-IP-adres-plavajuschim-ili-postojannym.html" target="_blank">Recognize IP type</a><br><br>
            After changing <b>Steam ID</b> and <b>IP</b> - there will be no ban.<br><br>
            <h2><b>2. Ban on Steam ID + IP + tags in config.cfg (dopban) (easy)</b></h2><br>
            <b>Dopban</b> - is a plugin (paid) that intercepts <b>fresh_ban</b> and writes you in <b>config.cfg</b> a label (random characters) in cvars/keys/bindings before the ban using the <b>client_cmd</b> function (sends you a command to the console via the <b>svc_stufftext</b> package) and checks your <b>config.cfg</b> for labels when you rejoin the server..<br>
            If the tag is there, you won't be able to log in even if you changed your <b>Steam ID</b> and <b>IP</b>.<br><br>
            To prevent dopban from tagging in <b>config.cfg</b>, you must enable <b>svc_stufftext</b> packet blocking, usually this feature is enabled by default in protectors.<br><br>
            Install protector or enable this feature in furion, go to Settings -> Protector -> Protect cs config (if you have version 1.795 or higher) or Misc -> Protector -> Protect cs config (if you have version lower than 1.795)<br><br>
            Once you enable <b>svc_stufftext</b> packet blocking - <b>dopban</b> will become helpless garbage, you will only have to change your <b>Steam ID</b> and <b>IP</b> (see the first point)<br><br>
            I would also like to add that using the <b>client_cmd</b> function that the <b>dopban</b> plugin uses, you can break <b>config.cfg</b> or clog up your disk with screenshots, so be sure to enable the <b>svc_stufftext</b> packet blocking feature :)<br><br>
            <h2><b>3. Ban on cookie (dopban) (easy)</b></h2><br>
            What is <b>DopBan</b> and what he can do with <b>CS</b> - we partially discussed in the previous paragraph, but these are not all the features of this plugin.<br><br>
            It has a function for cookie bans, but it is often not enabled by the scoofs (server creators) (don't know how to)<br><br>
            <b>Cookies</b> – are small text files that are saved on a user's computer or device when visiting a website/server.<br><br>
            Now you know what cookies are and that they can be sent to your browsers when you access the server, specifically through the <b>MOTD</b> window.<br><br>
            In order to <b>DopBan</b> Couldn't shove a cookie in your browser - turn it on <b>MOTD</b> block function in cheat (if you are using Furion - this function is located in the tab Misc->Misc->Motd block)<br><br>
            If, however, you've changed <b>IP</b> и <b>Steam ID</b> (first point), cleaned the config from tags or you had the block function enabled <b>svc_stufftext</b> package (protector) (second point), changed your nickname (at the end of the article you can read why you should do it) and the ban still remains - it means you have a cookie ban.<br><br>
            In order to bypass the cookie ban - download the program <b>BleachBit</b> (<a href ="https://www.bleachbit.org/download/windows" target="_blank">download</a>)<br>
            Run it and uncheck all the checkboxes except for <b>Cookies</b> in all browser tabs.<br><br>
            You can see on the screenshot how to tick the checkboxes, after ticking the checkboxes - click the button <b>Cleansing</b>, keep in mind that you'll be deleting all passwords and site settings.<br><br>
            <img src="../../Images/Articles/Proper checkmarking.png"></Images><br><br>
            This point concludes.<br><br>
            <h2><b>4. Subnet ban (medium)</b></h2><br>
            <b>Subnet</b> - network part.<br>
            Example: 77.73.69.0/24 is a subnet with <b>IP</b> addresses 77.73.69.1 through 77.73.69.254.<br><br>
            If the subnet 77.73.69.0 (where 0 is the already banned part) is banned, you will not be able to play with <b>IP</b> addresses whose subnet is "77.73.69".<br>
            That is, you can't play with <b>IP</b> addresses 77.73.69.15, 77.73.69.37, 77.73.69.125, and so on, because they all have the same subnetwork.<br><br>
            How do I know if a subnet has been blocked? - When you connect to the server, you will have no downloads, as if you have no internet connection.<br>
            How to bypass the blockage? - Reconnect to the <b>VPN</b> until it gives you a new subnet, or change region/country.<br><br>
            Don't forget to do the first and second item (if <b>dopban</b> is installed on the server)<br><br>
            <h2><b>More info</b></h2><br>
            There are still a couple more ban types (two left) and they're hard to get around already.<br>
            I'd tell you what types they are, but I can't, since server creators will run to put them on their servers, you don't want that, I guess)<br><br>
            By the way, if suddenly you are sure that 100% bypassed the ban, but for some reason the ban remains and you can not play - just change your nickname (this is not rofl)), it sometimes happens, rarely true, but it happens.

          🤔 How to bypass FPS detectors <br>🕒 Date of issue: 02.06.2024

          <h3><b>🤔 What is FPS and why it gives an advantage more in CS 1.6 than in CSS/CS:GO/CS 2</b></h3><br>
          FPS (frames per second) in CS 1.6 gives you an advantage in gaining speed due to the unique mechanics of the engine <b>GoldSrc</b>.<br><br>
          In CS 1.6/CSS/CS:GO/CS 2 you can get speed from strafes (synchronized movement of the keyboard and mouse in the same direction), but CSS/CS:GO have a <b>Source Engine</b> that doesn't allow you to get extra speed at the expense of FPS counts<br><br>
          That is, in CS 1.6 FPS + strafes = a lot of speed, but only if the server has set the sv_airaccelerate cvar (acceleration factor in the air) at least 50, preferably 100 or higher.<br><br>
          When creating a server, sv_airaccelerate defaults to 10, which doesn't allow you to get speed at the expense of streams, even if you have 999 fps.<br><br>
          The value of sv_airaccelerate is 100 or higher most often on deathrun and hns modes, but on any public or any other mode sv_airaccelerate can also be higher than the default 10, it all depends on the server creator and whether he changed the value of this cvar or not.<br><br>
          What is FPS and sv_airaccelerate we learned, and that a value of 100 or higher is most common on hns and deathrun servers.<br><br>
          On deathrun servers, there is usually no fps limit and you can play with any number of fps, while on hns servers, fps is usually limited to 100.<br><br>
          On hns servers they install fps detectors, and if your fps is over 100, you will be kicked.<br><br>
          <h3><b>🤔 How to bypass FPS detectors</b></h3><br>
          Bypassing FPS on hns servers will give an incredible advantage, below is how you can bypass one of the detectors:<br><br>
          <b>1.</b> If a packet detector is installed on the server <b>svc_sendcvarvalue/svc_sendcvarvalue2</b> - this packet can be blocked, so that when the detector checks the values of the cvars <b>fps_max/fps_override/developer</b> through the packet, it won't receive the packet and will let you through under the guise of a valid player.<br><br>
          To enable packet blocking <b>svc_sendcvarvalue/svc_sendcvarvalue2</b> - you need to enable the function <b>Sandbox cvars</b>, in furion, it's under the tab Settings -> Protector -> Defense cfg CS (if your version is 1.795 or higher) or Misc -> Protector -> Defense cfg CS (if your version is below 1.795)<br><br>
          <img src="../../Images/Articles/Sandbox cvars.jpg"></Images><br><br>
          <b>2.</b> If the server has an old and outdated detector that kicks you by using the disconnect command in the console, you can block the sending of this packet through the protector.<br><br>
          To do this, go to the Settings tab -> Protector -> Defense cfg CS (if your version is 1.795 or higher) or Misc -> Protector -> Defense cfg CS (if your version is below 1.795)<br><br>
          If the kick occurs through the svc_disconnect packet, you can also block it by going to the Console tab and checking the <b>Block svc_disconnect message</b> checkbox.<br>
          That's the end of the bypass, if the detector works in other ways, you won't be able to bypass it :(

          🏴‍☠ How to steal a player's Steam ID <br>🕒 Date of issue: 24.01.2024
        </button>
      </h2>
      <div id="6" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#Accordion">
        <div class="accordion-body"> 
          <h3><b>📢 Introduction</b></h3><br>
          By stealing someone else's Steam ID, you can get their level, ammo, bonuses, rank, privileges (not always)<br>
          <b>I recommend watching the video at the end of the article if you find it easier to watch than read.</b><br><br>
          😕 Nuances:<br>
          1. The stolen Steam ID will only work for two weeks and can only be stolen from Steam players, not from NonSteam players<br>
          2. You will not be able to play on the server if another player with the same Steam ID (author or another thief) is currently playing - due to Drpoto/Reunion<br>
          3. You must see the player's avatar whose Steam ID you are planning to steal or have already stolen. If you don't see it, you will be kicked without reason in 5-15 seconds. If you see it, you will be kicked in 2-3 minutes or not kicked at all (luck of the draw)<br>
          4. If privileges are linked by IP - hacking will not work<br><br>
          <h3><b>🪶 How Steam IDs were stolen before</b></h3><br>
          Previously, you could steal a Steam ID by simply moving the protector CtShield into the root folder of CS 1.6, typing the command ct_emu_set "Steam ID" in the console, and then rejoining the server.<br>
          This method no longer works due to being outdated at the current time.<br><br>
          <h3><b>⚙️ Server Preparation</b></h3><br>
          First, you need a hosting to create a server.<br>
          You can choose from paid (MyArena, CssServ, and others) as well as free, for example, like Castle Host.<br><br>
          After creating the server:<br>
          <img src="../../Images/Articles/Creating server.png"></Images>
          <img src="../../Images/Articles/Creating server 2.png"></Images><br><br>
          Set the value sag031 (for example) for the rcon_password cvar, and the value 0 for sv_lan in the cstrike/server.cfg file, and also change the server name through the hostname cvar.<br><br>
          After setting the cvar values, you need to install the necessary modules on the server, you can download them at the link <a href ="https://disk.yandex.ru/d/G0DgvXet6xE4ag" target="_blank">https://disk.yandex.ru/d/G0DgvXet6xE4ag</a>, installation is very simple - move the contents of the archive to the root of the server with replacement.<br><br>
          <img src="../../Images/Articles/Update server files.png"></Images><br><br>
          Also, you need to go to the link <a href ="https://github.com/HppForever/setinfo_stealer.sma" target="_blank">https://github.com/HppForever/setinfo_stealer.sma</a> and install this plugin, the installation is also very simple.<br><br>
          <img src="../../Images/Articles/Setinfo stealer installation.png"></Images><br><br>
          💧 What you have downloaded: (you can skip this information, as it is not necessary to know)<br>
          Metamod module (needed for plugin/module operation)<br>
          Reunion module (needed for allowing non-steam players to the server. You can actually not install this module, as we only need Steam players. Forget it or go to the plugins.ini file located at cstrike/addons/metamod/ and delete the line linux addons/reunion/reunion_mm_i386.so)<br>
          TicketDumper module (obtaining the necessary "Steam account data dump file" that we can later assign to ourselves through the cheat function, thereby obtaining someone else's Steam ID)<br>
          Setinfo stealer plugin (steals player passwords, requires AMXX, find out online how to install, it's quite simple)<br><br>
          Don't forget to check if you have correctly installed the modules on the server using the command meta list, and check if you have correctly installed the plugins using the command amxx plugins.<br><br>
          You should see your modules/plugins in the list.<br><br>

          If they are not there or if there is a substring "Error/Bad/Not loaded/Pause" or others - it means you have installed something incorrectly.<br><br>
          <h3><b>💭 How to invite a player to the server</b></h3><br>
          Change the hostname cvar value to a related name with the game mode and map, to get the victim's attention, and entice them to the server under various pretexts.<br>
          After the victim enters the server, we automatically get their data (ticket and password)<br><br>
          <h3><b>🏴‍☠ Getting player data</b></h3><br>
          After you have installed everything and the victim has joined the server, go to the cstrike/ticketsz/ folder.<br>
          If you have the latest ticket file, for example, 2023-12-25_14-16-24_76561199465566779.dat, then 76561199465566779 is the Steam ID 64 that we need.<br><br>
          By pasting it into a special website for searching for an account by Steam ID/Steam ID 2/Steam ID 64/URL, we can find out who exactly is the owner of this ticket based on their Steam avatar.<br><br>
          After obtaining the ticket, go to the cstrike/addons/amxmodx/configs/ folder and open the setinfo_stealer.log file.<br>
          Look for your victim there and get their passwords (_pw, _password, _pass)<br><br>
          <img src="../../Images/Articles/Check setinfo_stealer_log.png"></Images><br><br>
          After obtaining the ticket and password, we no longer need any other data.<br><br>
          <h3><b>🏁 Assigning someone else's data to ourselves (end)</b></h3><br>
          Move the ticket to a convenient folder, then enter a command in the console to set the victim's password (setinfo _pw "password" or setinfo _password "password", or setinfo _pass "password")<br><br>
          Inject Furion or ExtraMirror.<br><br>
          If you want to use ExtraMirror, you will find a working version without crashes, enter the command set_ticket "Path to the victim's ticket" in the CS 1.6 console (without Cyrillic).<br><br>
          If you want to use Furion, go to Misc -> Misc tab and find the Steam ID spoofer option, select Ticket below and enter the ticket path in Path to the ticket.<br><br>
          <img src="../../Images/Articles/[Furion] Set ticket.png"></Images><br><br>
          That's it, we have assigned someone else's Steam ID to ourselves through the cheat function and passwords through the console command setinfo "type password" "password".<br><br>
