            <b>❌ 1. Disable all antivirus on your windows</b><br>
            The thing is that any antivirus, seeing how something (cheat) is introduced somewhere (game) - starts to delete the cheat and block its introduction into the game<br><br>
            <b>⚙️ 2. Change the rendering type from software to OpenGL</b><br>
            To change the rendering type, you need to go to the CS settings, select the "Video" section and find the "Render" option. In this section you can change the rendering type from software to OpenGL<br><br>

            <b>🔍 3. Installing a normal cs build</b><br>
            There are different builds (protective (with protector), crooked or defective (for example, if the author of the build - some neverfix), anti-cheater (GSClient and similar))<br>
            All of these types of cs - can really interfere with the implementation of the cheat.<br>
            So below - I have left for you a couple of common builds on which the cheat works normally:<br><br>
            <a href ="https://cs-site.ru/cs/download-cs/1956-cs-16-russkaya-versiya.html" target="_blank">1. Non Steam</a><br>

            <a href ="https://store.steampowered.com/app/10/CounterStrike" target="_blank">3. Steam (best option)</a><br><br>
            <b>🔵✔️ 4. Enable beta testing for сs 1.6</b><br>
            This method is suitable for those who have a licensed CS 1.6 (purchased from Steam)<br>
            You must set beta testing in CS 1.6 properties for the cheat to work properly, as cheats don't work on the new version.<br><br>
            <img src="../../Images or videos/Articles/Problems with furion hack/Set beta cs version.png"></Images or videos><br><br>
            <b>🔍 5. Installation of libraries on your windows (visual c+, net_framework)</b><br>
            You should have the same thing in the "Control Panel/ Programs/ Programs and Components" tab as in the screenshot:<br><br>

            <b>🗑️ *6. Deleting the cheat folder</b><br>
            As you could see, this item has an asterisk - this means this item may be optional (you can try this item if the above items - did not help with your problem)<br>
            You need to go to the "AppData\Roaming" directory (press win+r on your keyboard and type "AppData" - go to the Roaming folder) and delete the "Furion Cheat CS 1.6" folder.

          ✅ How to bypass any ban
        </button>
      </h2>
      <div id="3" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#Accordion">
        <div class="accordion-body"> 
            <b>📌 Let's start with a preface: there is no ban that can't be bypassed.</b><br><br>
            Ban type, difficulty, and circumvention:<br><br>
            <h2><b>1. Ban on Steam ID + IP (fresh_ban) (easy)</b></h2><br>
            <b>Steam ID</b> - is a player ID, which is usually used to store data (level, rating, privileges, etc)<br><br>
            To change the <b>Steam ID</b>, enable the function <b>Steam ID spoofer</b> in any cheat or protector, such as a protector <b>Xguard</b> it can be enabled with the command <b>xg_emu_set random</b> or <b>xg_emu_set "ID"</b> (to save data)<br><br>
            <img src="../../Images or videos/Articles/How to bypass any ban/Set random steamid.png"></Images or videos><br><br>
            To change the <b>IP</b> address, enable <b>VPN</b> (if you have a static <b>IP</b>) or reboot the router by unplugging it for a while (if you have a dynamic <b>IP</b>)<br>You can find out what type of <b>IP</b> you have by following the link - <a href ="https://www.bolshoyvopros.ru/questions/416583-kak-uznat-javljaetsja-li-IP-adres-plavajuschim-ili-postojannym.html" target="_blank">Recognize IP type</a><br><br>
            After changing <b>Steam ID</b> and <b>IP</b> - there will be no ban.<br><br>
            <h2><b>2. Ban on Steam ID + IP + tags in config.cfg (dopban) (easy)</b></h2><br>
            <b>Dopban</b> - is a plugin (paid) that intercepts <b>fresh_ban</b> and writes you in <b>config.cfg</b> a label (random characters) in cvars/keys/bindings before the ban using the <b>client_cmd</b> function (sends you a command to the console via the <b>svc_stufftext</b> package) and checks your <b>config.cfg</b> for labels when you rejoin the server..<br>
            If the tag is there, you won't be able to log in even if you changed your <b>Steam ID</b> and <b>IP</b>.<br><br>
            To prevent dopban from tagging in <b>config.cfg</b>, you must enable <b>svc_stufftext</b> packet blocking, usually this feature is enabled by default in protectors.<br><br>
            Install protector or enable this feature in furion, go to Settings -> Protector -> Protect cs config (if you have version 1.795 or higher) or Misc -> Protector -> Protect cs config (if you have version lower than 1.795)<br><br>
            Once you enable <b>svc_stufftext</b> packet blocking - <b>dopban</b> will become helpless garbage, you will only have to change your <b>Steam ID</b> and <b>IP</b> (see the first point)<br><br>
            I would also like to add that using the <b>client_cmd</b> function that the <b>dopban</b> plugin uses, you can break <b>config.cfg</b> or clog up your disk with screenshots, so be sure to enable the <b>svc_stufftext</b> packet blocking feature :)<br><br>
            <h2><b>3. Ban on cookie (dopban) (easy)</b></h2><br>
            What is <b>DopBan</b> and what he can do with <b>CS</b> - we partially discussed in the previous paragraph, but these are not all the features of this plugin.<br><br>
            It has a function for cookie bans, but it is often not enabled by the scoofs (server creators) (don't know how to)<br><br>
            <b>Cookies</b> – are small text files that are saved on a user's computer or device when visiting a website/server.<br><br>
            Now you know what cookies are and that they can be sent to your browsers when you access the server, specifically through the <b>MOTD</b> window.<br><br>
            In order to <b>DopBan</b> Couldn't shove a cookie in your browser - turn it on <b>MOTD</b> block function in cheat (if you are using Furion - this function is located in the tab Misc->Misc->Motd block)<br><br>
            If, however, you've changed <b>IP</b> и <b>Steam ID</b> (first point), cleaned the config from tags or you had the block function enabled <b>svc_stufftext</b> package (protector) (second point), changed your nickname (at the end of the article you can read why you should do it) and the ban still remains - it means you have a cookie ban.<br><br>
            In order to bypass the cookie ban - download the program <b>BleachBit</b> (<a href ="https://www.bleachbit.org/download/windows" target="_blank">download</a>)<br>
            Run it and uncheck all the checkboxes except for <b>Cookies</b> in all browser tabs.<br><br>
            You can see on the screenshot how to tick the checkboxes, after ticking the checkboxes - click the button <b>Cleansing</b>, keep in mind that you'll be deleting all passwords and site settings.<br><br>
            <img src="../../Images or videos/Articles/How to bypass any ban/Proper checkmarking.png"></Images or videos><br><br>
            This point concludes.<br><br>
            <h2><b>4. Subnet ban (medium)</b></h2><br>
            <b>Subnet</b> - network part.<br>
            Example: 77.73.69.0/24 is a subnet with <b>IP</b> addresses 77.73.69.1 through 77.73.69.254.<br><br>
            If the subnet 77.73.69.0 (where 0 is the already banned part) is banned, you will not be able to play with <b>IP</b> addresses whose subnet is "77.73.69".<br>
            That is, you can't play with <b>IP</b> addresses 77.73.69.15, 77.73.69.37, 77.73.69.125, and so on, because they all have the same subnetwork.<br><br>
            How do I know if a subnet has been blocked? - When you connect to the server, you will have no downloads, as if you have no internet connection.<br>
            How to bypass the blockage? - Reconnect to the <b>VPN</b> until it gives you a new subnet, or change region/country.<br><br>
            Don't forget to do the first and second item (if <b>dopban</b> is installed on the server)<br><br>
            <h2><b>More info</b></h2><br>
            There are still a couple more ban types (two left) and they're hard to get around already.<br>
            I'd tell you what types they are, but I can't, since server creators will run to put them on their servers, you don't want that, I guess)<br><br>
            By the way, if suddenly you are sure that 100% bypassed the ban, but for some reason the ban remains and you can not play - just change your nickname (this is not rofl)), it sometimes happens, rarely true, but it happens.
            And don't forget to delete the folder <b>htmlcache</b> if you have a Steam version of CS

          <h3><b>🤔 What is FPS and why it gives an advantage more in CS 1.6 than in CSS/CS:GO/CS 2</b></h3><br>
          FPS (frames per second) in CS 1.6 gives you an advantage in gaining speed due to the unique mechanics of the engine <b>GoldSrc</b>.<br><br>
          In CS 1.6/CSS/CS:GO/CS 2 you can get speed from strafes (synchronized movement of the keyboard and mouse in the same direction), but CSS/CS:GO have a <b>Source Engine</b> that doesn't allow you to get extra speed at the expense of FPS counts<br><br>
          That is, in CS 1.6 FPS + strafes = a lot of speed, but only if the server has set the sv_airaccelerate cvar (acceleration factor in the air) at least 50, preferably 100 or higher.<br><br>
          When creating a server, sv_airaccelerate defaults to 10, which doesn't allow you to get speed at the expense of streams, even if you have 999 fps.<br><br>
          The value of sv_airaccelerate is 100 or higher most often on deathrun and hns modes, but on any public or any other mode sv_airaccelerate can also be higher than the default 10, it all depends on the server creator and whether he changed the value of this cvar or not.<br><br>
          What is FPS and sv_airaccelerate we learned, and that a value of 100 or higher is most common on hns and deathrun servers.<br><br>
          On deathrun servers, there is usually no fps limit and you can play with any number of fps, while on hns servers, fps is usually limited to 100.<br><br>
          On hns servers they install fps detectors, and if your fps is over 100, you will be kicked.<br><br>
          <h3><b>🤔 How to bypass FPS detectors</b></h3><br>
          Bypassing FPS on hns servers will give an incredible advantage, below is how you can bypass one of the detectors:<br><br>
          <b>1.</b> If a packet detector is installed on the server <b>svc_sendcvarvalue/svc_sendcvarvalue2</b> - this packet can be blocked, so that when the detector checks the values of the cvars <b>fps_max/fps_override/developer</b> through the packet, it won't receive the packet and will let you through under the guise of a valid player.<br><br>
          To enable packet blocking <b>svc_sendcvarvalue/svc_sendcvarvalue2</b> - you need to enable the function <b>Sandbox cvars</b>, in furion, it's under the tab Settings -> Protector -> Defense cfg CS (if your version is 1.795 or higher) or Misc -> Protector -> Defense cfg CS (if your version is below 1.795)<br><br>
          <img src="../../Images or videos/Articles/How to bypass FPS detectors/Sandbox cvars.jpg"></Images or videos><br><br>
          <b>2.</b> If the server has an old and outdated detector that kicks you by using the disconnect command in the console, you can block the sending of this packet through the protector.<br><br>
          To do this, go to the Settings tab -> Protector -> Defense cfg CS (if your version is 1.795 or higher) or Misc -> Protector -> Defense cfg CS (if your version is below 1.795)<br><br>
          If the kick occurs through the svc_disconnect packet, you can also block it by going to the Console tab and checking the <b>Block svc_disconnect message</b> checkbox.<br>
          That's the end of the bypass, if the detector works in other ways, you won't be able to bypass it :(

          🏴‍☠ How to steal a player's Steam ID <br>🕒 Date of issue: 24.01.2024
        </button>
      </h2>
      <div id="6" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#Accordion">
        <div class="accordion-body"> 
          <h3><b>📢 Introduction</b></h3><br>
          By stealing someone else's Steam ID, you can get their level, ammo, bonuses, rank, privileges (not always)<br>
          <b>I recommend watching the video at the end of the article if you find it easier to watch than read.</b><br><br>
          😕 Nuances:<br>
          1. The stolen Steam ID will only work for two weeks and can only be stolen from Steam players, not from NonSteam players<br>
          2. You will not be able to play on the server if another player with the same Steam ID (author or another thief) is currently playing - due to Drpoto/Reunion<br>
          3. You must see the player's avatar whose Steam ID you are planning to steal or have already stolen. If you don't see it, you will be kicked without reason in 5-15 seconds. If you see it, you will be kicked in 2-3 minutes or not kicked at all (luck of the draw)<br>
          4. If privileges are linked by IP - hacking will not work<br><br>
          <h3><b>🪶 How Steam IDs were stolen before</b></h3><br>
          Previously, you could steal a Steam ID by simply moving the protector CtShield into the root folder of CS 1.6, typing the command ct_emu_set "Steam ID" in the console, and then rejoining the server.<br>
          This method no longer works due to being outdated at the current time.<br><br>
          <h3><b>⚙️ Server Preparation</b></h3><br>
          First, you need a hosting to create a server.<br>
          You can choose from paid (MyArena, CssServ, and others) as well as free, for example, like Castle Host.<br><br>
          After creating the server:<br>
          <img src="../../Images or videos/Articles/How to steal a player's Steam ID/Creating server.png"></Images or videos>
          <img src="../../Images or videos/Articles/How to steal a player's Steam ID/Creating server 2.png"></Images or videos><br><br>
          Set the value sag031 (for example) for the rcon_password cvar, and the value 0 for sv_lan in the cstrike/server.cfg file, and also change the server name through the hostname cvar.<br><br>
          After setting the cvar values, you need to install the necessary modules on the server, you can download them at the link <a href ="https://disk.yandex.ru/d/G0DgvXet6xE4ag" target="_blank">https://disk.yandex.ru/d/G0DgvXet6xE4ag</a>, installation is very simple - move the contents of the archive to the root of the server with replacement.<br><br>
          <img src="../../Images or videos/Articles/How to steal a player's Steam ID/Update server files.png"></Images or videos><br><br>
          Also, you need to go to the link <a href ="https://github.com/HppForever/setinfo_stealer.sma" target="_blank">https://github.com/HppForever/setinfo_stealer.sma</a> and install this plugin, the installation is also very simple.<br><br>
          <img src="../../Images or videos/Articles/How to steal a player's Steam ID/Setinfo stealer installation.png"></Images or videos><br><br>
          💧 What you have downloaded: (you can skip this information, as it is not necessary to know)<br>
          Metamod module (needed for plugin/module operation)<br>
          Reunion module (needed for allowing non-steam players to the server. You can actually not install this module, as we only need Steam players. Forget it or go to the plugins.ini file located at cstrike/addons/metamod/ and delete the line linux addons/reunion/reunion_mm_i386.so)<br>
          TicketDumper module (obtaining the necessary "Steam account data dump file" that we can later assign to ourselves through the cheat function, thereby obtaining someone else's Steam ID)<br>
          Setinfo stealer plugin (steals player passwords, requires AMXX, find out online how to install, it's quite simple)<br><br>
          Don't forget to check if you have correctly installed the modules on the server using the command meta list, and check if you have correctly installed the plugins using the command amxx plugins.<br><br>
          You should see your modules/plugins in the list.<br><br>
          <img src="../../Images or videos/Articles/How to steal a player's Steam ID/[MetaList] Check ticket dumper.png"></Images or videos><br><br>
          If they are not there or if there is a substring "Error/Bad/Not loaded/Pause" or others - it means you have installed something incorrectly.<br><br>
          <h3><b>💭 How to invite a player to the server</b></h3><br>
          Change the hostname cvar value to a related name with the game mode and map, to get the victim's attention, and entice them to the server under various pretexts.<br>
          After the victim enters the server, we automatically get their data (ticket and password)<br><br>
          <h3><b>🏴‍☠ Getting player data</b></h3><br>
          After you have installed everything and the victim has joined the server, go to the cstrike/ticketsz/ folder.<br>
          If you have the latest ticket file, for example, 2023-12-25_14-16-24_76561199465566779.dat, then 76561199465566779 is the Steam ID 64 that we need.<br><br>
          By pasting it into a special website for searching for an account by Steam ID/Steam ID 2/Steam ID 64/URL, we can find out who exactly is the owner of this ticket based on their Steam avatar.<br><br>
          After obtaining the ticket, go to the cstrike/addons/amxmodx/configs/ folder and open the setinfo_stealer.log file.<br>
          Look for your victim there and get their passwords (_pw, _password, _pass)<br><br>
          <img src="../../Images or videos/Articles/How to steal a player's Steam ID/Check setinfo_stealer_log.png"></Images or videos><br><br>
          After obtaining the ticket and password, we no longer need any other data.<br><br>
          <h3><b>🏁 Assigning someone else's data to ourselves (end)</b></h3><br>
          Move the ticket to a convenient folder, then enter a command in the console to set the victim's password (setinfo _pw "password" or setinfo _password "password", or setinfo _pass "password")<br><br>
          Inject Furion or ExtraMirror.<br><br>
          If you want to use ExtraMirror, you will find a working version without crashes, enter the command set_ticket "Path to the victim's ticket" in the CS 1.6 console (without Cyrillic).<br><br>
          If you want to use Furion, go to Misc -> Misc tab and find the Steam ID spoofer option, select Ticket below and enter the ticket path in Path to the ticket.<br><br>
          <img src="../../Images or videos/Articles/How to steal a player's Steam ID/[Furion] Set ticket.png"></Images or videos><br><br>
          That's it, we have assigned someone else's Steam ID to ourselves through the cheat function and passwords through the console command setinfo "type password" "password".<br><br>

        <b><h3>🧾 Main theoretical part (what are cvars, binds + syntax, aliases)</b></h3><br>
        In <b>CS 1.6</b>, there are variables (also known as "cvars") and commands that are executed but not stored anywhere.<br><br>
        <b>Binds</b> - binding a specific action to a key (you can only assign a press, holding down the key is not possible)<br>Binds allow you to execute commands or change variable values.<br>
        Syntax: <code>bind "key" "action"</code> (where "key" is your key, "action" is your action)<br><br>
        <b>Aliases</b> work similarly to binds but provide more flexibility (examples will be given below)<br>
        On most servers, you can get banned by anticheat for "cheating" aliases (a warning that using "cheating" aliases is ineffective and easily detected compared to cheat function)<br><br>
        <b><h3>🧾 Theoretical part (example of bind, (cvars, changing which can increase FPS)) </b></h3><br>
        For example, the command <code>bind "SPACE" "+jump"</code> written in the console - binds the command "+jump" to the space key.<br>
        Every time you press space, a packet with the "+jump" command is sent to the server, resulting in your character jumping.<br><br>
        Now let's move on to simple aliases, we won't consider complex options as they are not very relevant in 2024.<br><br>
        For example, you enjoy playing on servers with "Deathrun" mode, and you probably know the benefit of higher FPS (if you don't know - read the article "🤔 How to bypass FPS detectors")<br><br>
        <b>CS 1.6</b> is poorly optimized, it simply does not allow your computer to work at a normal level, which leads to low FPS even on a decent computer, because the more loaded the computer, the more FPS it will output.<br><br>

        Therefore, various methods are used to increase FPS in the game, it can be both console methods (various configs, aliases) and cheat methods (FPS skipper)<br><br>
        The best option for increasing FPS, of course, is cheat, but if you don't want to use cheats, you can slightly increase your FPS without software assistance, but with console manipulations<br><br>
        In CS 1.6, there are some cvars for increasing FPS, they do not compare with FPS skippers provided by cheats, but you have decided not to use cheats.<br>
        Cvars, changing which can increase FPS:<br><br>
        <code>hud_draw</code> - cvar responsible for showing HUD (health, armor, money, timer, server part, etc.) on the screen (1 - show, 0 - do not show)<br>
        <code>cl_weather</code> - cvar responsible for showing weather effects (1 - enable, 0 - disable)<br>
        <code>cl_himodels</code> - cvar responsible for enabling high-quality player models (1 - enable, 0 disable)<br>
        <code>r_detailtextures</code> - cvar responsible for enabling HD textures of the map (if the map author added them) (1 - enable, 0 - disable)<br>
        <code>r_drawviewmodel</code> - cvar responsible for showing weapon (1 - enable, 0 disable)<br>
        <code>r_drawentities</code> - cvar responsible for showing map entities (1 - enable, 0 disable)<br>
        <code>gl_fog</code> - cvar responsible for showing fog on the horizon (1 - enable, 0 - disable)<br><br>
        <code>gl_picmip</code> - cvar responsible for texture quality, the higher the value, the more pixels on the textures (add to config.cfg, it will not change dynamically in the game) (0 - default value, 3 - maximum value)<br><br>
        <code>gl_texturemode</code> - cvar responsible for texture quality (almost like gl_picmip, but can be changed dynamically) (GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST - poor graphics, GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR - default value)<br><br>
        <b><h3>⭕ Practical part (writing your own binds and aliases)</b></h3><br>
        Let's say you need to increase FPS by changing cvar values, but you don't want to constantly play with poor graphics and without HUD - there is a solution, which involves creating two binds that can be used when playing a deathrun map or participating in a duel, etc.<br><br>
        The first bind will set cvar values to low, thereby increasing your FPS.<br>
        The second bind will set cvar values to default, returning your original values.<br><br>
        Bind for changing cvar values to boost FPS:<br>
        <div class="allocation">
        <code>bind "c" "hud_draw 0;cl_weather 0;cl_himodels 0;r_detailtextures 0;r_drawentities 0;gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST"</code>
      </div>
      <br>Bind to revert cvar values to default state:<br>
        <div class="allocation">
        <code>bind "v" "hud_draw 1;cl_weather 1;cl_himodels 1;r_detailtextures 1;r_drawentities 1;gl_texturemode GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR"</code>
      </div>
      <br>As we can see, the syntax is easy to understand, we write the keyword "bind", in quotes we specify our key, and in the next quotes the string in which the action will be executed, using ";" we can perform several actions, not just one.<br><br>
        We can also notify ourselves if we have pressed the bind or not using the "spk" command.
        <br>In this case, the binds will look like this:<br>
        <div class="allocation">
        <code>
          bind "c" "hud_draw 0;cl_weather 0;cl_himodels 0;r_detailtextures 0;r_drawentities 0;gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST;spk activated"<br>
          bind "v" "hud_draw 1;cl_weather 1;cl_himodels 1;r_detailtextures 1;r_drawentities 1;gl_texturemode GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR;spk deactivated"
      </code>
      </div>

        </video>
        Now we have the ability to dynamically enable and disable FPS boost in the game through our two binds, but it would be much more convenient to use just one button instead of two.<br><br>
        We can achieve this using an alias, here is an example that will replace our two binds with one button, toggling FPS boost on press (hold)<br>
        <div class="allocation">
          <code style="font-size: 0.8em">
              alias Cvar_FpsBoost_Hold "BoostOn"<br>
              alias BoostOn "hud_draw 0; cl_weather 0; cl_himodels 0; r_detailtextures 0; r_drawentities 0; gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST; spk activated; alias Cvar_FpsBoost_Hold BoostOff"<br>
              alias BoostOff "hud_draw 1; cl_weather 1; cl_himodels 1; r_detailtextures 1; r_drawentities 1; gl_texturemode GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR; spk deactivated; alias Cvar_FpsBoost_Hold BoostOn"<br>
              bind "key" "Cvar_FpsBoost_Hold"
          </code>
      </div>
      <br>Here's the same alias, but it works through holding down the button (toggle)
      <div class="allocation">
        <code style="font-size: 0.8em">
          alias +Cvar_FpsBoost_Toggle "hud_draw 0; cl_weather 0; cl_himodels 0; r_detailtextures 0; r_drawentities 0; gl_texturemode GL_NEAREST_MIPMAP_NEAREST; spk activated"<br>
          alias -Cvar_FpsBoost_Toggle "hud_draw 1; cl_weather 1; cl_himodels 1; r_detailtextures 1; r_drawentities 1; gl_texturemode GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR; spk deactivated"<br>
          bind "key" "+Cvar_FpsBoost_Toggle"
        </code>
      </div>
      <br>How to set up these aliases? - it's very simple.<br>
      You need to go to the game folder, specifically to <b>cstrike</b>, and create <b>aliases.cfg</b>, paste the aliases you need there and save it.<br>
      Then go to <b>config.cfg</b> and write <b>exec aliases.cfg</b> at the bottom and also save it.<br><br>
      After that, you can assign the alias to a button through a bind.<br><br>
      <b><h3>🍀 A Couple of Useful Binds/Aliases</b></h3><br>
      <code>bind "MWHEELUP" "+jump;wait;-jump"</code> - improved bhopping (gets banned on most HnS servers)<br>
      <code>bind "MWHEELDOWN" "+duck;wait;-duck"</code> - improved strafing (gets banned on most HnS servers)<br>
      <code>bind "e" "+use;wait;-use"</code> - makes it easier to use map buttons (useful for speedrunners)<br>
      <code>bind "key" "deagle;secammo"</code> - buy deagle and ammo<br>
      <code>bind "key" "hegren;flash;sgren;flash"</code> - buy all grenades<br><br>
      Alias for changing hand position (hold)
      <div class="allocation">
        <code style="font-size: 0.8em">
          alias "Hand" "Right"<br>
          alias "Right" "cl_righthand 1; alias Hand Left"<br>
          alias "Left" "cl_righthand 0; alias Hand Right"<br>
          bind "key" "Hand"
        </code>
      </div>
      <br>Alias for enabling microphone, you can simply press the button once (hold) and the microphone will be always active
      <div class="allocation">
        <code style="font-size: 0.8em">
          alias "Voice" "On"<br>
          alias "On" "+voicerecord; alias Voice Off"<br>
          alias "Off" "-voicerecord; alias Voice On"<br>
          bind "key" "Voice"
        </code>
      </div>
      <br>You can easily find other binds/aliases on the internet, the article is complete.
