        - Added automatic deletion of the "htmlcache" folder upon cheat injection (the folder exists only in Steam builds and may contain ban markers)<br><br>
        - Added detection of client protectors such as "XGuard" and "ExtraMirror" during cheat injection and output of warnings in the console about possible conflicts<br>For example, if a fake console command fps_max is sent through the sandbox in the client protector and the cheat’s sandbox also sends a fake console command — a conflict occurs. The same goes for blocking server commands (svc_stufftext), etc.<br><br>
        - Output of players' setinfo when pressing the button "Output players' setinfo to console (by mark lotven)" is now color-coded<br><br>
        - Added the ability to overlay colors on the chams and glow for dead enemies and yourself (for example, living player - green, dead - black)<br><br>
        - Added icons and the ability to change their color (ordinary, hovered, true), and of course, rainbow mode is present<br><br>
        - Added a "Main" sub-tab in the "Movement" tab, containing sub-tabs for: "Bhop", "Groundstrafe", "Bugs", "Strafes"<br><br>

        - Added a "Main" sub-tab in the "Visuals" tab, containing sub-tabs for: "Esp", "Chams", "Glow", "Effects"<br><br>
        - The "Local" sub-tab in the "Visuals" tab has been split into several sub-tabs: "Main", "Chams", "Glow", "Other"<br><br>
        - The "Knifebot" sub-tab in the "Misc" tab has been split into several sub-tabs: "Main", "Helpers", "Checks"<br><br>
        - The "Miscellaneous" sub-tab has been renamed to "Fake latency"<br><br>
        - Fixed the auto-save feature for sub-tabs (for example, "Visuals->Main->Chams", etc.)<br><br>
        - Now, if the "Activate" checkbox for a tab is inactive, all text in the tab will be colored "Text disabled"<br><br>
        - Added an "Activate" checkbox for the "Misc" and "Console" tabs; when disabled, no function will work<br><br>
        - Removed the slider "How much FPS to use during stab" in the "Knifebot" tab<br><br>

        - Added a "Refresh models" button in "Visuals->Changers->Model changer" (for optimization)<br><br>
        - Fixed the hands rendering when the "Freelook" function was enabled, and that the camera would not fly out of the player if the active checkbox had no button binding<br><br>
        - Fixed the rage aim not targeting the nearest player<br><br>
        - Fixed FPS dropping when displaying sky textures in the "Visuals->Changers->Sky changer" tab (thanks to Garey for the caching idea), also removed the checkbox for displaying sky textures; they will now always be displayed<br><br>
        - Rewrote the system for setting any visual elements on the screen from screen resolution to percentage of resolution (now if you set 50% on both x and y in your configuration and give it to a friend with a different monitor - it will still display in the middle)<br><br>
        - Added "Watermark" in "Visuals->Hud info->Watermark"<br><br>
        - Improved the work of the "Fix auto movement" function located in "Visuals->Menu", which now resets presses excellently.

            - Added "Angle changer" tab in "Movement" and also the first two functions in it.

        - Added an "Advanced settings" checkbox in the Misc -> Knifebot tab that simply hides the kb settings that are considered advanced settings<br><br>
        - Added "Perpetual m_filter 0" feature. The thing is that when you use the "Strafe helper" function with the sensa type "High" from the "Movement->Strafes" tab, you get m_filter = 1 (mouse filtering) and it stays even when you turn off the strafe helper. This feature will help you disable mouse filtering<br><br>

        - Added "Freelook" feature to the "Visuals->Effects" tab and added camera speed slider<br><br>

        - Added ability to change hood color in "Visuals->Local" tab + rainbow mode of course<br><br>
        - Added "Fallrun" feature to the "Movement->Groundstrafe" tab, it gives a big speed boost on inclined surfaces<br><br>

        - Added ability to see where the grenade will fly to in the "Visuals->Effects" tab<br><br>
        - Added "Auto speed reduction" function for "AirStuck"<br><br>
        - Added content for the "Anti - Afk" feature, and as it is now in a new tab "Movement->Other"<br><br>

In addition, you will not see the information on the screen (speed, damage, jump height, fps, etc that is in hud info) and also the scope<br><br>
        - Added protector (sandbox cvars, cs protection) to the "Console->Other" tab<br><br>

       - Replaced hitboxes checkboxes with a regular combo list, which saves space in the cheat menu and looks more beautiful<br><br>
       - Added "Auto duck" function, which automatically crouches while moving. This allows you to better defend yourself from enemies' blows and control your speed. However, do not forget to increase power when using this feature, as the player moves much slower in a ducked position than in a standing position<br><br>
       - Added "Auto shoot" function, which automatically shoots while moving. This function is useful, for example, if you want to nightmare someone, but not with a knife, but, for example, with AK-47<br><br>
       - The power of the sliders has been increased by a factor of 6, even though the values have remained the same (1-3000)<br>This means that if you set the power to 1000, for example, you will have 6000 power, and if you set the maximum power value to 3k, you will have 18000 power<br><br>
       - Now, as it should, the goto will fly to the nearest player, not a random one<br><br>
       ------------------------------------------------<br><br>
       - Added "Auto jof" function to "Movement->Other" and an edge slider for it<br><br>
       - The "Write hideradar on cs startup" function has been fixed. Now it correctly hides the default ks radar<br><br>

       - Movement content has been fixed. Now, when the player dies, all functions of the Movement tab will be automatically turned off. This means that now you can safely die with the fps skipper, and there will no longer be a black screen<br><br>
       - Frame skipping (fps skipper) has been moved from the "Movement->Strafes" tab to the "Movement->Fps boost" tab. Also added combo list, in which you can select the condition of operation (always or only when rage strafe is working)<br><br>

       - Added Strafe helper to the "Movement->Strafes" tab<br><br>

        - Changed the log about the successful injection of the cheat, now it is more informative<br><br>
        - When you create a new cfg, you will be greeted with a new GUI theme rather than a black and orange one<br><br>
        - Added 3 new GUI themes to the list of themes, namely "Green Water", "Blood Water", "Crystal"<br><br>
        - Now you have to go to Settings to change the location of the tabs (right or left), and there is no longer a "Swap" button at the top<br><br>
        - Now the bhop settings etc are stored in the "movement.ini" file, not in "kreedz.ini" as before. I suggest to move the settings to a new file or you can start from scratch<br><br>
        - Added "Afk mode" function for knifebot, it will be useful for legitimate game (you will not be able to hit someone when you write something in chat or went away on business)<br><br>

        - The gui elements in the "GUI" tab work again, you can make your own themes without problems<br><br>
        - Added separators (lines separating the place) in the "Visuals" tab in sub tabs - for beauty)<br><br>
        - Added "AirStuck" function (hovering in the air) to the "Movement->Other" tab and the power slider to it (the higher the value - the more reliable we hover in the air, but there will be various glitches (such as - will not see messages, hear howling, etc))<br><br>
        - Added the ability to cancel the bind of any function using the "Cancel" button in the button type selection (hold, toggle) as well as Unbind list (reset buttons) in "Misc->Other"<br><br>
        - Removed unnecessary function "Enable SteamId spoffer" in "Misc->Other" now you just need to enable "Random SteamId" to change the steam id<br><br>
        - Now the "x" and "y" values in the statistics, as well as the width and length of the menus, etc, are set depending on your screen resolution. For example, if your resolution is 768x1024, the "x" slider value will be 768 and the "y" slider value will be 974 (-50 to stay within the screen width limit)<br><br>
        - The logic of the "Anti Afk" function has been rewritten, now it is enough to enable this function without setting the angle and time - there will be no detection<br><br>
        - Added the ability to change the hand based on the current weapon on the player (knife left, weapon right or knife right, weapon left)<br><br>
        - Added "List of functions" function to the "Visuals->Statistics" section. With its help you can see which functions are currently activated<br><br>
        - Removed the "(Ground) Max Speed (Degree)" slider in "Movement->Main" and the "(Bhop) Type" combo since it doesn't provide any use<br><br>
        - Added "FakeLag" function bind<br><br>
        - Added fog (crouch) customization for groundstrafe. Changing the fog allows you to perfectly jump off the boogarks or get into bushes, as well as visually stand out among other players. However, it should be noted that using this feature may lead to detection on servers with anticheat<br><br>
        - Added two buttons to "Console->Other" that allow you to spam with a flashlight or parachute<br><br>
        - Added two conditions for rage strafes: the first allows bhoping along with rage strafe, and the second allows groundstrafe (ddrun, sgs) along with rage strafe. These two conditions may come in handy for someone, for example, if someone is short on fingers<br><br>
        - Added team counter (tt, ct) to the "Statistics->Team Counter" tab<br><br>

        - Now the minimum number of skip frames (skip frames) starts from 0 and ends at 5, since it makes no sense to set it more<br><br>
        - Added the ability to hide your pressed keys from the server and also spam them when activating rage strafe you can surprise someone :)<br><br>
        - Added two conditions for fake ping (Turn off when tt, Turn off when ct) - these checks are useful for hns and zm modes(on hns for example there is no sense to use fake ping when you tt, similarly on zm)<br><br>

        - Added a button to switch the strike for knifebot (stab/slash) useful for knife servers since slash hits farther than stab you can combine it and drag almost everyone
